**Web Design Agency Project**
This is a simple website I built to practice my web development skills — focusing on responsive design using just HTML and CSS.

The site is a mock landing page for a creative agency. It highlights two main sections:

_Beauty_ – clean, modern design

_Construction _– strong structure and layout

I used the Poppins font from Google Fonts, and added media queries to make sure the layout looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.

**How to use**
Just open index.html in your browser. No setup or installation needed.
